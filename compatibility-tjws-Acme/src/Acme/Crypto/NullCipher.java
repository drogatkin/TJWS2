/// The null encryption method.
// <P>
// This is a block cipher that just copies input to output, unmodified.
// It's mostly for testing. However, using the null cipher in CBC mode,
// for example via EncryptedOutputStream and EncryptedInputStream, turns
// out to hash things up enough to protect against casual inspection.
// There may be applications where this is appropriate.
