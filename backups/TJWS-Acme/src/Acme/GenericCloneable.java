/// A convenience parent for Cloneable classes.
// <P>
// In the current JDK, the API for cloning is slightly broken. The intent
// was for classes that didn't need to clone any sub-objects to be able to
// just add an "implements Cloneable" and have everything work. However,
// as it stands now, such classes still need to implement a clone method.
// <P>
// What's annoying is that all of these no-sub-objects clone methods are
// completely identical. Every one of them looks like this:
// <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
// public Object clone()
// {
// try
// {
// return super.clone();
// }
// catch ( CloneNotSupportedException e )
// {
// // Shouldn't happen.
// throw new InternalError( e.toString() );
// }
// }
// </PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
// Well, what this class does is implement that clone method. If your
// class doesn't need to have anything else as parent (true for "struct"
// classes), then just make GenericCloneable the parent and presto, you're
// cloneable.
