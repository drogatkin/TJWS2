ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* README.md
* bee-dexwar.xml
* bee-sign.xml
* default.properties
* doc/
* doc/Creation web application for Atrjeews.docx
* doc/atjeews_main.png
* doc/atjeews_manage.png
* doc/atjeews_settings.png
* doc/feauture_graphics.png
* doc/future
* doc/hires_app_icon.png
* doc/promo.png
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/jasper-7.0.27.1.jar => app/libs/jasper-7.0.27.1.jar
* libs/javax.websocket-api-1.0-rc5.jar => app/libs/javax.websocket-api-1.0-rc5.jar
* libs/javax.websocket-client-api-1.0-rc5.jar => app/libs/javax.websocket-client-api-1.0-rc5.jar
* libs/servlet-2-3.jar => app/libs/servlet-2-3.jar
* libs/war.jar => app/libs/war.jar
* libs/webserver.jar => app/libs/webserver.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/rogatkin/mobile/web/RCServ.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/rogatkin/mobile/web/RCServ.aidl

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
